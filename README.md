# PyStockBot

PyStockBot is a comprehensive machine learning-powered stock prediction and analysis platform that combines advanced Python data processing with a modern web dashboard interface.

**DISCLAIMER:** *In general, there is no preference given to any of these metrics, models, and resources, this is not a recommendation to use them. Besides implementing and categorizing them Uhstray.io and all contributors are not officially suggesting any opinion on any of these, Uhstray.io and any contributors are not financial advisors. Do your own due diligence and speak to a professional financial advisor before making any financial decisions.*

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

PyStockBot consists of two main components:

### 1. Python ML Pipeline (`stonks/` & `crypto/`)
- **Data Collection**: Automated fetching from Yahoo Finance, market events, and corporate actions
- **Feature Engineering**: 200+ technical indicators including moving averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ADX, Fibonacci retracements, and Hurst exponent
- **Machine Learning**: XGBoost and other models for price prediction and market analysis
- **Multi-Asset Support**: Stocks, cryptocurrencies, ETFs, and indices

### 2. Next.js Dashboard (`ui/`)
- **Modern UI**: React 19 + Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- **Professional Design**: Financial-focused interface with dark/light themes
- **Interactive Charts**: Real-time visualizations using Recharts
- **Multiple Dashboards**: ML predictions, market indicators, social sentiment, earnings analysis, and asset tracking
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile viewing

## Trading Design Architecture

![Trading Design Architecture](.images/pystockbot.excalidraw.svg)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13+
- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (for UI development)

### Python Environment Setup

This project uses `uv` as the Python package manager for faster dependency resolution:

```bash
# Install uv
pip install -U uv

# Install Python dependencies
uv sync
```

### UI Development Setup

```bash
# Navigate to UI directory
cd ui

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Run linting
pnpm lint
```

## 📊 ML Pipeline Execution

Run the Jupyter notebooks in sequence to execute the complete ML pipeline:

### Core Pipeline
1. **`pull_data.ipynb`** - Fetch OHLCV market data from Yahoo Finance
2. **`pull_events.ipynb`** - Collect market events and news sentiment
3. **`pull_dividends_splits.ipynb`** - Gather dividend and stock split data
4. **`prepare_dataset.ipynb`** - Advanced feature engineering with technical indicators
5. **`train_model.ipynb`** - Train ML models (XGBoost, neural networks)
6. **`analyze_model.ipynb`** - Model evaluation and performance analysis

### Additional Notebooks
- **`adx_rsi_trendlines.ipynb`** - Specialized ADX and RSI analysis
- **`valid_trendlines.ipynb`** - Trendline validation and pattern recognition

## 🎯 Key Features

ore Principles

Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
Maintain clean, readable code
Make minimal edits rather than large rewrites
Avoid duplicate code; reuse and refactor when possible

Code Structure

Keep files concise when possible, but prioritize logical organization over strict line count
Files can exceed 300 lines when appropriate, especially for styling files or when splitting would reduce clarity
Evaluate 3-5 approaches before implementing the best option
Use well-documented, mainstream libraries/repos

Documentation & Communication

Maintain INFO.MD with major changes and important context
Add meaningful comments to explain complex logic
Document design decisions and alternatives considered

Development Process

Think through every feature before implementation
Test thoroughly before suggesting changes
Propose clear organization strategies for the codebase

Quality Assurance

Prioritize code cleanliness and maintainability
Review all suggestions for potential issues
Consider edge cases and error handling
- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to
